# MMM-DHT-Sensors
This an extension for the [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).

The intention is to access DHT11/DHT22 sensors directly within MM without any cronjobs and submitted data via textfiles or stdout/stdin. Both temperature and humidity are displayed onscreen. 

## Usage

The  [BCM2835](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/) library is required on your raspberry pi.

WORK IN PROGRESS!
